# MachineLearning-Practices
This repository records my processing of learning machine learning algorithms and code practice

## [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms/home/info)
  by DeepLearning.AI & Stanford University

## Reflection:
How to make the machine learning models more accurate?
1. Get more trainning samples
2. Try more/ less sets of features
3. Try additional Polynomial features
4. Try to decrease/ increase Lambda (learning rate)
